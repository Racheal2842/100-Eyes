1. Introduction

Good vision is a cornerstone of quality life, yet many individuals suffer from preventable and treatable eye conditions due to financial constraints and lack of awareness. "100 Eyes" is a community-based initiative designed to bridge this gap by providing free vision screenings, prescription glasses, essential eye medications, and targeted public awareness on sight-threatening diseases to the residents of Sura Local Government, Lagos.

Beyond vision correction, this project serves as a vital public health campaign against glaucoma, hypertensive retinopathy, and diabetic retinopathy—three leading causes of irreversible blindness. Glaucoma, often called the "silent thief of sight," gradually damages the optic nerve without early symptoms, making regular eye check-ups essential. Similarly, hypertension and diabetes, which are increasingly prevalent in Nigeria, have devastating effects on eye health. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to hypertensive retinopathy, where blood vessels in the retina become damaged, causing vision loss. Likewise, diabetic retinopathy results from prolonged high blood sugar levels, leading to retinal damage, bleeding, and eventual blindness if left untreated.

By integrating vision care with health education, "100 Eyes" aims to not only restore sight but also empower individuals with the knowledge to protect their vision for a lifetime. Through free screenings, prescription glasses, medications, and educational materials in local dialects, this initiative will foster a healthier, more informed community.
